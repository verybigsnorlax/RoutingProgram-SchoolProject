## About this Project
This project was completed for my Data and Algorithms II course at WGU.

<a name='Scenario'></a>
### Project Scenario
The given scenario for the project:

_The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements._

_Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages (listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File”) will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGU has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and to justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts._

_Keep in mind that the supervisor should be able to see, at assigned points, the progress of each truck and its packages by any of the variables listed in the “WGUPS Package File,” including what has been delivered and at what time the delivery occurred._

### Built With
This program was built using Python with no additional libaries. The project environment includes Windows 10 using Sublime Text.

<a name='Usage'></a>
## Usage
In order to run the program, make sure you have Python version 3.9 or higher.

For Windows:

After installing Python 3 on your machine, navigate to the same directory as main.py on your CMD or Powershell. Then run the command: 
`python main.py`

For Linux:

In your terminal run the command:
`python3 -version`
This is to make sure Python 3 is installed and to check the version of the Python 3 installed on the machine.
If the terminal returns an error, make sure you install Python 3 on your machine.

After installing Python 3, navigate to the same directory as main.py on your terminal. Then run the command:
`python3 main.py`
